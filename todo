# TODO

manpage
 should contain basically the variables of module.awk

module.awk
 exec() which should imitate xargs
 string.format(%q)
 exec(array)
  will execute array when arglimit is reached, so you can launch command with multiple arguments

getflags?
 so you know if there are actual files in args

stat
 output as a csv with headers
  (setting the module variables is a matter of looking into the csv header...?)
 dates wont output UTC? (-0400) at the end, unlike normal stat (use date(%Y)?)
 output realpath for symbolic links

main
 examine $awkargs and if variable exists, format is modified
 RS and FS should be modifiable and inherited
  RS is \x00
  FS is is RS (or \x1E)
  change formats to be in alphabetical order, reflect that change here as well

Misc
 move formats to formats.awk, format makes the awkmodule
