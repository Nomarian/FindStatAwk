a manpage

getflags so you know if there are actual files in args

stat output as a csv with header
then setting the module variables is a matter of looking into the csv header...?

beware of symbolic links
'/home/pi/Proj/AsciiDT/examples/GeoIPCountryWhois.csv' -> '/home/pi/.weechat/country/GeoIPCountryWhois.csv'


# TODO
 # Must change formats to be in alphabetical order, reflect that change here as well
# move formats to formats.awk, format makes the awkmodule
# function erase(){ deleteit = deleteit file } SANITIZE FOR rm!
# END { "rm " deletit }
# exec(array) will execute array when arglimit is reached, so you can launch command with multiple arguments
# 

# date(%Y)?
# stat -format dates wont output UTC? (-0400) at the end, unlike normal stat
#

have an args examiner that will build format correctly and will also build a formats.awk correctly
basically looks at all the variables you're using and if you use a variable, then $1 will contain that variable
$1 is the filename of course.
